From my understanding, the fundamental essence of every religion revolves around fostering love, promoting sharing, encouraging kindness, cultivating generosity, helping each other, and recognizing the inherent humanity in all people. These core principles form the bedrock of religious teachings across the globe. If religious institutions and their followers had rigorously adhered to these foundational tenets, I believe the allegiance to these faiths would have been not only great but also transformative for society as a whole.
However, upon closer examination of the current religious landscape, we observe a stark departure from these noble ideals. Many religious institutions have evolved into entities that wield considerable power and influence, often extending beyond spiritual matters. They have assumed roles that involve dictating various aspects of individuals' personal lives and, in some cases, fostering an environment of intolerance towards those who hold different beliefs or come from diverse backgrounds. These doubts and fostered distances are some of the main root causes of active wars in some corners of this world.
It is particularly concerning to witness the frequent collaboration between religious leaders and political figures, forming alliances aimed at securing electoral victories or, in extreme cases, even justifying armed conflicts.
This shift in the role of religions has led to the creation of divisions among people rather than unity. Instead of bridging gaps, religions are now often responsible for erecting barriers and sowing seeds of doubt. We are witnessing a troubling trend where many religious institutions are deviating from their own core principles, transforming from sources of spiritual guidance into instruments of social control.
This situation naturally leads us to question the relevance and importance of religion in our contemporary lives. One perspective suggests that while the original founders of various religions may have had pure and altruistic intentions, subsequent religious leaders have, over time, altered or reinterpreted these core principles to serve their personal goals or maintain their positions of authority. What's equally concerning is the tendency of many followers to adhere to religious doctrines without critically examining or questioning this “shift” and the directives of their leaders, leading to a form of blind faith that can be easily manipulated.
The cumulative effect of these developments is a gradual erosion of joy and harmony in our society. We find ourselves in a world where trust between different groups is diminishing, replaced by suspicion, polarization and a growing tendency to distance ourselves from those who don't share our beliefs. This atmosphere of mistrust and separation stands in stark contrast to the unifying principles that religions originally sought to promote.
I see a growing trend on social media where people publicly insult those from other religions. But hey, listen—didn't your own religion teach you to love one another? When you choose to dehumanize others, it's clear you're not following your own religion's teachings, no matter how strictly you claim to adhere to its practices.
While every religion espouses principles of simplicity and humility, advocating for a modest and down-to-earth lifestyle, we often observe a stark contrast in the lives of many religious leaders. These figures, who are meant to embody the core values of their faith, frequently choose to reside in opulent and expensive buildings, far removed from the simple existence they preach. This discrepancy extends beyond their living arrangements; many religious leaders surround themselves with armed bodyguards for protection. This apparent contradiction between the teachings of simplicity and the lavish lifestyles of religious leaders highlights the sharp contrast between core religious teachings and their actual lifestyles.
It's crucial to recognize that this is not the kind of religious influence that benefits humanity. When a religious institution engages in activities such as promoting violence, forming alliances with political entities for electoral gains, or cultivating hatred towards other groups, it has essentially strayed from its spiritual purpose. In such cases, what we're witnessing is not the practice of genuine religion, but rather the machinations of a powerful institution using religious rhetoric as a tool for control and influence. This deviation from true spiritual values calls for serious reflection and reevaluation of how we engage with and interpret religious teachings in our modern world.
When it comes to fostering joy and nurturing hope in our global society, these aspirations cannot be fully realized until the citizens of the world begin to cultivate a deep-seated trust in one another. This trust forms the foundation upon which we can build a more harmonious and compassionate world. To achieve this, we must actively work towards mitigating or completely overcoming the barriers that have been erected by religious differences over time. These barriers, often rooted in misunderstanding and fear of the unfamiliar, have served to divide rather than unite humanity.
For today's joy and mental peace, let me share a delightful and meaningful video I created in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, a few years ago. The video aims to build cross-cultural bridges and promote "One Love." In it, I perform Punjabi Bhangra alongside Buffalo Boy Productions, a First Nations dance group representing various Tribal Nations of North America. They showcase traditional First Nations dances, creating a beautiful blend of cultures:
Instead of allowing these divisions to persist, we need to embrace a broader, more inclusive perspective that recognizes the inherent value and dignity of all human beings, regardless of their religious affiliations or beliefs. This shift in mindset involves moving beyond the confines of traditional religious boundaries and adopting a more universal approach to spirituality and ethics. By embracing humanity itself as our true 'religion', we can create a shared ethical framework that transcends individual belief systems and focuses on our common human experiences, needs, and aspirations.
This approach doesn't require abandoning personal faith or spiritual practices. Instead, it encourages expanding our circle of empathy, seeing things outside of the box, and understanding to include all of humanity. By doing so, we can build a world where mutual respect, compassion, and cooperation guide our interactions. This paves the way for a more joyful, hopeful, and harmonious global community, and even our own local neighbourhoods.
