I find this archival footage from Australia is fair dinkum powerful.
That’s almost as much as I wanna say about it, in the video, which is the opposite of an Ozzy Man talkative commentary…
Yeah nah yeah. It’s a sensitive topic. Obviously it’s on my mind because we see a shooting in Georgia, USA in the news cycle down here today.
Of course, USA and and Australia are different countries, I’m not oblivious to that… I am very aware of that and the nuance involved. There’s something about the sheer pragmatism and blatant action of crushin’ guns that’s kinda impactful to look at though, yeah? Boiling shit down to pure simplicity.
Apologies in advance if this upsets any American Ozzy Man fans. I get the issue is drummed on about a lot domestically, internationally, I’m sure you’ve built some robust resilience to it? The chatter that comes from everywhere around the world that is. But yeah, nah, to sound Canadian for a moment: Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I can’t help execute my cheeky ideas in my own way and I still like to produce content a few times a year that at least has a strong theme or discussion or message to it.
But I absolutely don’t wanna piss off anyone on Subby Stacky that is here because of O-Man, and yeah, there’s always an extreme nervousness around content like this if I post it on the mainstream platforms.
Ah crap.
Cheers,
