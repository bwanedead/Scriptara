Buckle up; in this episode, we explore the emerging field of ketamine therapy for mental health treatment with Dr. Jennifer Ellice, a board-certified emergency physician based in Los Angeles. Dr. Ellice, who studied at Princeton University and the University of Rochester School of Medicine before completing her residency at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, brings extensive experience in emergency medicine since 2008 to her current specialization in ketamine therapy as the Co-Founder of Golden Afternoon.
The conversation delves into ketamine's potential for treating depression, anxiety, PTSD, and chronic pain while addressing common misconceptions and safety concerns. Dr. Ellice discusses the medical applications of ketamine beyond its traditional use as an anesthetic, drawing on her diverse medical background.
Viewers will gain access to the clinical process, from patient screening to administration methods, and witness an unprecedented insider's view as Kevin allows cameras to document his experience during a live ketamine booster therapy session. This rare, unfiltered look into an actual treatment aims to demystify the process, reduce stigma, and potentially help those suffering from mental health issues see ketamine therapy as a viable option. Kevin's willingness to share this deeply personal experience underscores the importance of open dialogue about mental health treatments and advancing public understanding of innovative therapies.
This episode aims to provide a balanced, scientific perspective on a promising but complex treatment option in modern psychiatry, guided by Dr. Ellice’s unique blend of emergency medicine expertise and cutting-edge mental health treatment knowledge.
